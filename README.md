# Dwarf-gas-dispersion

A quick code to take the output from a GEAR simulation (see Revaz & Jablonka 2012) and calculate the dispersion in the gas, this should be below a threshold value at low metallicity.
This is a slightly stripped down version of the main code run, which involved looping over around ten thousand simulations and outputting appropriately.
For reasons of simplicity the kernel choice is hardcoded in.
